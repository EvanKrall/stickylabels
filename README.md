# stickylabels
HTML/CSS for putting content on printable adhesive labels.

Make an HTML file that includes the `avery5167.css` stylesheet, then put the contents of each label in a `<span class="label">`.
The labels will be arranged in rows.

To define a new template, start with `avery5167.css` as a guide.
