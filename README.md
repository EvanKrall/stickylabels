# stickylabels
I wanted a really easy way to programmatically generate a bunch of labels, so I wrote this HTML/CSS.

# To use
Make an HTML file that includes the `avery5167.css` stylesheet, then put the contents of each label in a `<span class="label">`.
The labels will be arranged in rows.
Check out [demo.html](/demo.html).

# To make your own template

Start with `avery5167.css` as a guide.
